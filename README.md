Hi, my name is Chris North. I'm currently studying Computer Science with desire to become software engineer.
I'm looking forward to work with Python enthusiasts whose abilities are at begginer level, so we can grow together.
Fluent in speaking English and Polish. Currently living in Poland, hoping to move to Ireland next year.
